# Introduction

The Copernica Marketing Suite allows you to create, send and process emails. 
It gives detailed statistics of your recent email campaigns in a clear
and easy to use interface. The Marketing Suite is not feature complete yet, 
however we are working hard to incorporate all current features of publisher.copernica.com
and many new ones into our new interface.

## Drag and drop Template Editor

One of main features of new Marketing Suite is Drag & Drop Template Editor. This
editor allows creating email templates without knowledge of HTML or CSS. And because  
the whole editor is based on [ResposinveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com),
all emails created with the drag-and-drop editor are responsive.
