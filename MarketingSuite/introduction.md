# Introduction

The Copernica Marketing Suite is Copernica's new, easy-to-use interface. In
this new interface you can design, personalize and send your email campaigns. 
The interface also shows detailed statistics of your past and ongoing campaigns.
Whilst the Marketing Suite is fully equipped to help you send and create email
marketing campagins, it is not feature complete just yet and we are currently 
working hard on adding new and more advanced features. 

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to send a message
to [Richard Hordijk](mailto:richard.hordijk@copernica.com).

## Drag and drop Template Editor

Creating email messages in the Marketing Suite does not requires any knowledge
of HTML and CSS. The Marketing Suite is equipped with an easy to use drag-and-drop editor. 
In a drag-and-drop editor you no longer need to use HTML or CSS to create your emails: 
it allows you to design emails by simply dragging and dropping content onto your
template. 

The editor uses [ResponsiveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com), a service to create responsive emails
made by Copernica, which makes all emails created in the editor are automatically responsive.

## Sending Email

After creating your email you can use the marketing suite's send-interface to set up
your email campaign. Pick a target selection from your database and start sending 
right away, or schedule your campaigns for another time.

## Email statistics

For every email sent the marketing suite shows detailed statistics. Track opens, clicks and 
see your open- and click-through rate. Detailed graphs show you exactly when and on what device 
your recipients opened or clicked in your emails.

## Magento integration

For users with a Magento webshop the Marketing Suite has a built-in [Magento](http://magento.com) integration. 
This integration synchronizes the data in your Magento Webshop with a database that is specially designed
for Magento. This makes it easy to set up email campaigns based on data form your Magento webshop.

### Things you still have to do in the old Publisher environment 

If you landed on this page, you probably have access to (and maybe also worked in) the Publisher environment. Publisher will eventually replaced by the Copernica Marketing Suite, of which this drag and drop template editor is just a tiny part. Replacing this extensive but outdated software package obviously takes some time. 

Things like managing your lists, unsubscribe behaviour, creating web forms, landing pages, creating emails with advances personalization are not possible in the Copernica Marketing Suite and still need to be done in the old software.

The old Publisher environment can be accessed via [publisher.copernica.com](https://publisher.copernica.com) and requires the same login credentials.  

If your login credentials don't give you access to publisher.copernica.com, please get in touch with our support department via [support@copernica.com](mailto:support@copernica.com).
