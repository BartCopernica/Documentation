# Introduction

Our new Marketing Suite allows you to compose, send and process emailings. 
Finally, it will be replacing current set of tools completely, but even now
it integrates with old tools (like database management and SOAP/REST API).

## Drag and drop Template Editor

One of main features of new Marketing Suite is Drag & Drop Template Editor. This
editor allows creating emailing templates with no knowledge of HTML or CSS. And 
since whole editor is based on [ResposinveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com),
making responsive email templates is easy.
