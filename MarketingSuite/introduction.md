## Overview of the editor

The template editor allows you to design and put together your own email templates without having to write any HTML and CSS code yourself. The user interface of the editor basically consists of 4 main parts. 

[Template editor overview](//media.copernica.com/Documentation/overview.png)

 1. **Toolbox:** Drag any item from this toolbox onto your screen. While dragging, this toolbox will contain options related to the item or block that is being dragged.  
 2. **Canvas:** This is the workspace that you will be using to compose your emailing templates. Drag items from the toolbox onto the canvas to use them as blocks in your template.  
 3. **Settings panel:** The Settings panel contains all the settings directly related to the active block.  
 4. **Topbar:** Quick access to basic actions, such as saving your template, previewing, setup a mass mailing and so forth.

####Compatibility and responsiveness

All emails created with the editor are automatically made responsive, which means that they render good on all sorts of devices, such as mobile phones, desktop computers and tablets. 

Also, you don't have to worry about how your email looks in the wide variety of email clients available these days, such as Outlook and Gmail. The HTML generated by the editor is tested extensively in all major clients and platforms to ensure that every subscriber sees the email as you intended.

### Before you even get started...

This template editor is galaxies away from the final we have in mind. As a matter of fact, it is still being developed by our dedicated team of cavia's and space monkeys. While working with the editor, you will most likely search yourself an accident for basic features that are not even implemented yet. Also, you might sometimes encounter hidious bugs and grotesque user interface errors. As this product is under heavy development, we'd love to hear your feedback. And if you need a life saving feature, just drop us a line. It's probably already on our todo list, but maybe we can make it happen quicker if that makes you a more happy person. 

If you have any questions or comments about the template editor please send an email to [Richard Hordijk](mailto:richard.hordijk@copernica.com). 

#### Things that you cannot do with this template editor

...but that we are working on or planning to start with soon.

- Block conditions: you cannot show or hide template blocks based on subscriber data
- The posibility to add Google Tracking variables (or other link parameters) 
- Style and text formatting properties. There are some, but definately not all. 
- RSS Feed integration
- Social media buttons
- File and image library
- Ability to quickly send a testmail
- Extended email deliverability check (DKIM, Sender ID, SPF). 
- And probably a lot more...

#### Stuff you still have to do in the old Publisher environment 

If you landed on this page, you probably have access to (and maybe also worked in) the Publisher environment. Publisher will eventually replaced by the Copernica Marketing Suite, of which this drag and drop template editor is just a tiny part. Replacing this extensive but outdated software package obviously takes some time. 

Things like managing your lists, unsubscribe behaviour, creating web forms, landing pages, creating emails with advances personalization are not possible in the Copernica Marketing Suite and still need to be done in the old software.

The old Publisher environment can be accessed via [publisher.copernica.com](https://publisher.copernica.com) and requires the same login credentials.  

If your login credentials don't give you access to publisher.copernica.com, please get in touch with our support department via [support@copernica.com](mailto:support@copernica.com).

#### Width the of the email
Emails created with [this first version of ] the template editor have a fixed width of 580 pixels. On smaller devices (mobile phones), the content blocks of the email will be stacked vertically. 

## Drag and drop system

Building an email template wont be a drag anymore. It is just a matter of dragging and dropping, or as we say in the Netherlands: 'Sleur en pleur'.

### Drag item to canvas
To add blocks to the canvas, just drag an item from toolbox to the template canvas and drop it at any location where it says 'Drop here'. Once it is dropped into position you can directly further edit the block properties from the right settings panel. Blocks dragged onto the canvas can easily be edited or rearranged using the same drag 'n dropping technique.

###Change item position
To rearrange the location of a block, click on it and start dragging it to the new position. 

[insert video here]

###Change columns position
The editor allows you to vertically rearrange an entire **columns block** at once. To move an entire row of columns, position your cursor in-between two containing blocks and start draggin' it to the new position.  

[insert video here]

### Deleting a block
Blocks can be easily removed from your canvas. While dragging an item, you will see that the toolbox becomes one big trashcan. Drag the block into the dumpster to remove the block. 

## Block types
To build your email templates, you can choose from different block types. All with their unique purpose and traits. The available block types are explained in more detail in the next tiny chapters.  

<div class="toolbox-sprite columns"></div>
### Columns block
The **columns block** allows you to split your mailing into two or more different columns. Once you created your columns, you can drag any other block into these columns. 

Directly after you dropped the **columns block** into position, you will be prompted to choose the number of columns. Clicking on one of the options will directly create these columns. You can now drop any other item into these columns.

You can add as many **column blocks** to your email as needed. Just like any other block type, you can rearrange the position of a **columns block** by draggin' it and drop it at any other location in your design where it says 'drop here'. 

####Responsiveness of columns
On smaller devices (mobile phones) the columns and its containing blocks will be stacked vertically and become full width (100%). 

[insert image to illustrate]

#### Columns background color
Unlike other types of blocks, the **columns block** doesn't come with its own settings panel. You can change the background color of a column (or multiple columns) by selecting a block inside it. In the tab **Background** of that block you will find the options for setting the background color for that specific block, or its containing column or row.

#### Nesting columns and changing columns
In the current version of the editor it is not possible to drag new columns into an already existing column. Nor is it posible to change the number of columns of a **columns block** that was already added to the canvas. If you want to merge two columns together that already has content, it works best to drag a new **columns block** underneath it, and then move the content of the first block to the one below. That should save some time, until we release a more user friendly solution :)

<div class="toolbox-sprite heading"></div>
### Heading block
The heading block allows you to add textual headers to your email design, similar to HTML header (`<h1>`, `<h2>` etcetera). In the settings panel you can edit the header content text, and see the options to change the appearance of the header, such as color, size and font type. 

<div class="toolbox-sprite button"></div>
### Button block
Adds a button to your design. In the settings panel you'll find options to style the button and to specify the internet address where it should point to when it is clicked.

<div class="toolbox-sprite seperator"></div>
### Seperator block
The **seperator block** is used to add a horizontal rule (similar to the HTML `<hr>` tag) above or under another block. 

<div class="toolbox-sprite image"></div>
### Image block
Add images to your email design. After dropping the *image* item onto the canvas, you can choose the image and further configure it from the settings panel. 

The image can be imported by uploading it from your computer, or by specifying the online location of the image. Images will automatically be stored on our servers to ensure that the image remains available in your emails, even when they are opened in a distant future.

Options for the image's appearance and to make it clickable can also be found in the side panel. 

You can only import images of type `.gif`, `.jpg` and `.png`. These are the most save image types for use on the web.

#### Image size
Optionally you can specify the width of an image. This allows you to make the image smaller than the container that it is placed in. If you do not set the width, the image will be shown in it's actual size. Images in an email will never become bigger than the container they are placed in, even if the real image file is bigger than the available space. This means that an image in an email can never exceed 580 pixels, because that it the max size of the email content. 

When resizing, the software only scales the image for you, meaning that it is not actually resized and compressed. A 4mb image will remain a 4mb image. Make sure to resize large images before uploading it, as it is not yet possible to edit, scale, crop or adjust images in the editor (we are working on this of course).

<div class="toolbox-sprite spacer"></div>
### Spacer block
Adds whitespace under or above another block. You can specify the height of this block in pixels from the settings panel.

<div class="toolbox-sprite text"></div>
### Text / HTML block
The **text block** allows you to add large chunks of text to your email design. Using a *Rich Text Editor* you can make paragraphs, headers, change colors, add hyperlinks et cetera.  

If you are however more comfortable with writing HTML or just want more control about the HTML that is outputted, you can switch to the HTML source by clicking on the **Source** button inside the Rich Text Editor. 

Although you are allowed to add any HTML inside the *source* box, we advice to only use basic HTML as advanced HTML may break the email layout in some email clients.

<div class="toolbox-sprite webversion"></div>
### Webversion link block
Some people prefer to open emails in their normal web browser rather than in an email client. A version of the email that can be opened with a normal webbrowser is usually called the *webversion*. The editor automatically creates a webversion of each email you send with the application.
 
To add a link to this webversion, just drag the item into your design. The click text and appearance of the link can be set in the settings panel of this block.

Clicking on this link will open the subscriber's internet browser and load the email in a new browser tab. When any personalization code is used, the receiver will see the webversion tailored with his of her details.  

####Include webversion link inside a text block

A link to the webversion can also be added inside a text / HTML block, by creating a link, and point it to `{webversion}`. 

**Example:**

 ``<a href="{webversion}">Click here to view the webversion</a>``

<div class="toolbox-sprite unsubscribe"></div>
### Unsubscribe link block
The **unsubscribe link** is similar to the beforementioned webversion link, the only difference being that by clicking on this link the subscriber will remove himself from the mailinglist. 

All commercial emails you send with the Marketing Suite, must have this link included. What happens to unsubscribers (they can be removed from the database, or just removed from a specific list) is set in the Publisher environment.  

####Create unsubscribe link inside text block

A link to the opt-out form can also be added inside a text / HTML block, by creating a link, and point it to `{unsubscribe}`. 

**Example:** 

``<a href="{unsubscribe}">By clicking on this link, I hereby state that I no longer wish to receive these emails.</a>``

<div class="toolbox-sprite video"></div>
### Video block 
The *video block* provides the ability to add videos to your emails. Because embedding videos is disabled by most email clients, the editor will show a clickable screenshot of the video instead. When it is clicked, the user will either be sent to the website hosting the video, or -if specified- a custom landing page. 

When loaded inside the webversion, the actual video can be embedded inside the page or the thumbnail of the video can be shown.

At the moment, only videos hosted on Youtube.com and Vimeo.com are supported, butmore video sites will be included in the near future. Please drop us a line if you have special desires for a specific (N)SFW video platform. 

##Basic features

### Saving a template
To save a template, just find and click the so-called option in the menu **Template** from the application topbar. If you haven't named your template yet, you will be prompted to provide a name for your template first. This name is for your own reference in the software and will not be visible to receivers of the emails based on the template. 

When your email template has unsaved changes, a message about this will appear in the topbar . You can click on this message to quickly store the latest version.

### Removing a template
To delete a template from existence, click the **Remove** item in the menu **Template**. You will be asked to confirm the removal first. After that, the template is deleted from our servers (not only from your account).

Statistics and reports of mailings sent with a template will remain in tact after it is deleted.   

### Go back to last saved state
If you are unhappy about recent modifications, you can easily go back to how it was since the last time you saved your design.

To reload the template, choose **Reload** from the **Template** menu. 

Changes made after the last save will then be discarded. Please remind that this action cannot be undone. 

###Make copy of template
The whole point about templates is of course that you can use them in different mailings, albeit with totally different content. 

This is accomplished by simply creating a *clone* of the active template. The option to do so is found in the **Template** menu. After choosing a name for the copy and your confirmation, you'll automatically be redirected to the cloned template.

### Editing the sender information and subject
To edit the `from name`, `from address` and `subject` of the template, just click on the items above the active template. 

[Insert video]

## Template source

In the template menu, you'll see an item **source**. Clicking this item will not bring you tothe HTML source of the email (as you propbably expected), but to the **JSON** source of the template. JSON? Let us elaborate. 

JSON is a computer thingy to describe and store information in a structured way. It is quite similar to the more widely known format XML, but much more powerfull. 

The template editor is built on a webservice that is able to read JSON, and transform this into the HTML that can be read by email clients.   

Actually, this webservice is built by us, and more information about that can be found on [www.responsiveemail.com](www.responsiveemail.com). 

Go to **Source** to view the source, and to manually edit the JSON source. 

## Template preview and testing
The template preview shows you an accurate depiction of how emails sent with this template would render in the subscriber's email client.

Inside *preview mode*, you can see how the email would look on various screensizes, by clicking the icons in the top left corner. 
 
There's also a print button, in case you want to send your newsletter per post mail. Don't forget to stamp the enveloppe sufficient. 

## Personalization
Emails created with the Copernica MS email template editor can of course be personalized with data about your subcribers. For example to start your email with `Hi James`, instead of `Hi Mr or Miss Anonymous`.

To write and process personalization, we use our own inhouse created SmartTPL, which has a syntax based on the widely known Smarty Templating Engine. 

### Where can I use personalization?
You can include personalization code in the email template itself, and in all input fields that have that dollar sign ($) on the right.

Documentation about our SmartTPL Personalization engine is in the making, but since the syntax is 99% similar to Smarty personalization, you can also take a look at our [old documentation](https://www.copernica.com/en/blog/personalize-campaigns).

## Block settings panel

Clicking a block on your canvas (except the columns block) will bring up its related settings in the right panel. Changes that you make with the settings panel are directly applied to the active template in the canvas. 

In the first tab, you will find settings just for that block. The other tabs **Style**, **Visibility** and **Background** are available at all other blocks (unless stated otherwise) and are futher explained in the next chapters. 

### The Style tab
Allows you to change the visual appearance of the block. For example, the font type and size of the text, or the color of the button. 

#### Block spacing and background widget
At most block types you will encounter the block spacing and background widget. Use this widget to add space around (margin) or inside (padding) the block. In the center of the widget, you can set the background color of the block. 

<img src="//media.copernica.com/Documentation/blockspacingwidget.png" />

### The Visibility tab
Maybe the coolest thing of this email template editor is that you can enable or disable specific content based on the device on which it is displayed, and based on the interests of the receiver. To enable this feature, you'll find the tab **Visibility** at the *Settings panel* of the block. With this setting you can exactly specify under what circumstances the content should be visible in the mail, and under what circumstances the content should be hidden.

### The Background tab
Set the background color for the active block, the centered content or the entire email. If you are using columns in your email design, you can also specify the background color for blocks in the the same column, or the entire row with columns (from left to right).

##Template settings

Settings for the entire template are set from the **Template Settings** panel. The easiest way to open the panel is by clicking anywhere in the grey area above the active template.

From here, you can edit the template name, sender name, from address, subject and so forth. Also you can set the template text version, style and background color.
   
### Text version of the template
Responsive emails are created with HTML and CSS. For email clients that do not support HTML or for subscribers who choose to receive plain text mails only, you can include a pure text version of the mail that is automatically sent along with the HTML email.

The text version is normally not visible because the majority of the email clients support HTML. However, we still strongly advise to also set a text version, because these days the text version is often utilized to show the summary of an email in the mailbox, or on devices with very small screens like those modern age watches, fridges and future poststamps. Sending along a text version allegedly improves email deliverability.

Newly created email templates are automatically prefilled with a default text and a link to go to the webversion of the email.

##Sending an emailing

To send a massmailing to a mailinglist, click on **Send emailing** in the topbar. This will bring you to the mass mailing settings, where you set the target, the timestamp and the other related settings. 

### Choosing the target of the emailing. 
The target of an emailing can be an entire database, a selection, an entire data collection or a miniselection. The target chooser lets you select any of these targets. 

<img src="//media.copernica.com/Documentation/target-chooser.png" />

These targets are not created in the template editor, but in the old Publisher environment. 
[Creating mailinglists using selections in the old Publisher environment](https://www.copernica.com/en/blog/selections-and-miniselections).

Targets created in Publisher are automatically available in the template editor when setting up a mailing.

#### For magento webshop owners
If you have your Magento webshop synchronized with Copernica, you can also choose one of the predefined Magento targets or any targets that you have created yourself in our Magento Sync module.  

### Date and time of sending
By default, a mailing will be sent immediately after you hit the **confirm and send** button in the final step. Alternatively you can choose to schedule the mailing on a future date or/and to automatically repeat the mailing with a specific interval.

To schedule and/or repeat the mailing, click the link at the **Date and Time** section when settings up a new mailing. 

<img src="//media.copernica.com/Documentation/schedule-mailing.png" />


### Review mailing settings
Before you finally send a mailing, we let you perform a final check on all the settings first. In case you stumble upon an error or mistake, click the related **Edit** button to make your adjustment.

### Sending the mailing
You can now finally send your mailing. Hit the **Send** button on the preview page to start the mailing. Your mailing will start sending immediately or be scheduled if you've chose to send it in the future.  

### Cancelling or editing a scheduled mailing
Setting of scheduled mailings that haven't started sending yet can be cancelled or edited. 

### Changing template content 
After you've setup a scheduled mailing, you can still make modifications to the template, for example to change its content or improve typos. The final version of the email template will be sent. 

## Reports and statistics
To give you insight into how your mailing scored, Copernica keeps extended statistics of all mailings sent via the software. 

### Mailing report and statistics
To see the results of your emailing, go to the [sent mailings overview](#/stats/mailings) to find mailing you're looking for. You can always find the link to this module in the side menu. 

For each mailing, we show the results (among a lot of other things) of the clicks, errors, opens, unsubscribes recorded in your mailing. In the **Report module** itself you can read back how things are exacly calculated and what these figures mean.

<img src="//media.copernica.com/Documentation/mailing-reports.png" />

### Template report and statistics
The same template can be used in different mailings. To see how (the mailings with ) a template scored, go to the overview for [mailing statistics grouped by template](#/stats/templates).
