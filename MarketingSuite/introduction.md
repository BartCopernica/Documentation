# Introduction

The Copernica Marketing Suite allows you to create, send and process emails. 
It gives detailed statistics of your recent email campaigns in a clear
and easy to use interface. The Marketing Suite is not feature complete yet, 
however we are working hard to incorporate all current features of publisher.copernica.com
and many new ones into our new interface.

If you have any questions about the marketing suite or template editor please send a message
to [Richard Hordijk](mailto:richard.hordijk@copernica.com).

## Drag and drop Template Editor

One of main features of new Marketing Suite is Drag & Drop Template Editor. This
editor allows you to create email templates without any knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Simply drag and drop content into your template to design your own email. The editor
uses [ResponsiveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com), a service to create responsive emails
made by Copernica, which means all emails created in the editor are automatically responsive.

## Email sending

After creating your email you can use the marketing suite's send-interface to set up
your email campaign. Pick a target selection and start sending right away, or schedule
them for later.
