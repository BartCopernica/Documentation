# Toolbox

The toolbox of the drag-and-dop editor is located on the left side of the interface. 
It shows a list of blocks that can be dragged to onto the [canvas](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/ui/canvas).

The toolbox can be used by moving the mouse button towards the block you want to use (e.g.
a text or image block), holding down the mouse button and then moving it towards your canvas.
Once you start moving your first block the words "drop here" will appear on the screen, which
shows where you can drop the current block you are holding. Move your mouse over the block and
release the left mouse button. Congratulations, you have placed your first block!

If you already have one or more blocks in your canvas, the "drop here" message will only appear
once you get close to the top or bottom edge of a block (the places where you can drop a block). 

Read more about the different kind of [blocks](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor/) in 
the editor.
