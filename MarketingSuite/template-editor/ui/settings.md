# Block settings panel

Clicking a block on your canvas (except the columns block) will bring up its 
related settings in the right panel. Changes that you make with the settings 
panel are directly applied to the active template in the canvas. 

In the first tab, you will find settings just for that block. The other tabs 
**Style**, **Visibility** and **Background** are available at all other blocks 
(unless stated otherwise) and are further explained in the next chapters. 

## The Style tab

Allows you to change the visual appearance of the block. For example, the font 
type and size of the text, or the color of the button. 

### Block spacing and background widget

At most block types you will encounter the block spacing and background widget. 
Use this widget to add space around (margin) or inside (padding) the block. In 
the center of the widget, you can set the background color of the block. 

## The Visibility tab

Maybe the coolest thing of this email template editor is that you can enable or 
disable specific content based on the device on which it is displayed, and based 
on the interests of the receiver. To enable this feature, you'll find the tab
**Visibility** at the *Settings panel* of the block. With this setting you can 
exactly specify under what circumstances the content should be visible in the 
mail, and under what circumstances the content should be hidden.

## The Background tab

Set the background color for the active block, the centered content or the 
entire email. If you are using columns in your email design, you can also 
specify the background color for blocks in the the same column, or the entire 
row with columns (from left to right).

# Template settings

Settings for the entire template are set from the **Template Settings** panel. 
The easiest way to open the panel is by clicking anywhere in the grey area above 
the active template.

From here, you can edit the template name, sender name, from address, subject and 
so forth. Also you can set the template text version, style and background color.
   
## Text version of the template

Responsive emails are created with HTML and CSS. For email clients that do not 
support HTML or for subscribers who choose to receive plain text mails only, 
you can include a pure text version of the mail that is automatically sent along 
with the HTML email.

The text version is normally not visible because the majority of the email clients 
support HTML. However, we still strongly advise to also set a text version,
because these days the text version is often utilized to show the summary of an
email in the mailbox, or on devices with very small screens like those modern 
age watches. Sending along a text version allegedly improves email deliverability.

Newly created email templates are automatically prefilled with a default text 
and a link to go to the webversion of the email.
