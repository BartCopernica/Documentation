# Template source

In the template menu, you'll see an item **source**. Clicking this item will not 
bring you to the HTML source of the email (as you probably expected), but to 
the **JSON** source of the template.

Template Editor is using [ResponsiveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com) library.
This library is designed to create proper HTML emails from smaller building blocks.

Go to **Source** to view the source, and to manually edit the JSON source.
