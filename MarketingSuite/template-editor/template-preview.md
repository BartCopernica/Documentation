# Template preview and testing

The template preview shows you an accurate depiction of how emails sent with 
this template would render in the subscriber's email client.

Inside *preview mode*, you can see how the email would look on various 
screen sizes, by clicking the icons in the top left corner. 
 
There's also a print button, in case you want to send your newsletter per post 
mail. Don't forget to stamp the envelope sufficient.
