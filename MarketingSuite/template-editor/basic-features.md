# Basic features

## Saving a template

To save a template, just find and click **Template** option in the menu from 
the application top bar. If you haven't named your template yet, you will be 
prompted to provide a name for your template first. This name is for your own 
reference in the software and will not be visible to receivers of the emails 
based on the template. 

When your email template has unsaved changes, a message about this will appear 
in the top bar. You can click on this message to quickly store the latest version.

## Removing a template

To delete a template from existence, click the **Remove** item in 
the **Template** menu. You will be asked to confirm the removal first. After that, 
the template is deleted from our servers (not only from your account).

Statistics and reports of mailings sent with a template will remain intact after 
it is deleted.   

## Go back to last saved state

If you are unhappy about recent modifications, you can easily go back to how it 
was since the last time you saved your design.

To reload the template, choose **Reload** from the **Template** menu. 

Changes made after the last save will then be discarded. Please remind that this 
action cannot be undone. 

## Make copy of template

The whole point about templates is of course that you can use them in different 
mailings, albeit with totally different content. 

This is accomplished by simply creating a *clone* of the active template. 
The option to do so is found in the **Template** menu. After choosing a name for 
the copy and your confirmation, you'll automatically be redirected to 
the cloned template.

## Editing the sender information and subject

To edit the _from name_, _from address_ and _subject_ of the template, just click 
on the items above the active template.
