# Responsiveness

Marketing Suite uses [ResponsiveEmail](http://www.responsiveemail.com) library
for composing emails. That means responsiveness of email templates is on by 
default.

that JSON code will be displayed. This code will be code that eventually will be
interpreted by ResponsivEmail library.
