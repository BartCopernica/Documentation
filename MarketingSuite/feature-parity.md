# Feature parity

Our old software (Publisher) and our new software (MarketingSuite) differ in 
available features. Eventually all features from old software will be revised 
and incorporated into new software.

# Marketing Suite features

Currently available features within Marketing Suite are:

* [Template editor](copernica-docs:MarketingSuite/template-editor)
