# Statistics

To give you insight into how your mailing scored, Copernica keeps extended 
statistics of all mailings sent via the software. 

## Mailing report and statistics

To see the results of your emailing, go to the sent mailings overview
to find mailing you're looking for. You can always find the link to this module
in the side menu. 

For each mailing, we show the results (among a lot of other things) of the 
clicks, errors, opens, unsubscribes recorded in your mailing. In the 
**Report module** itself you can read back how things are exacly calculated and 
what these figures mean.

## Template report and statistics
The same template can be used in different mailings. To see how (the mailings 
with) a template scored, go to the overview for mailing statistics grouped by 
template.
