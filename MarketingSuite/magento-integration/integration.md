# Integration

Copernica provides official [Magento integration](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/copernica.html).
This extension uses a custom-for-Magento API to communicate between Copernica 
and Magento. It's available on [Magento Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/copernica.html) 
platform free of charge.

## Open source

Integration is open source and source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/MAGENTO).
Everyone can contribute to it's development.

## Old extension

Inside Magento Connect platform users can find two extensions. [One](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/copernica.html) 
is created by Copernica and it's designed to work with Marketing Suite. 
Second one is maintained by partner company, [Cream](http://www.cream.nl/). This 
extension was developed with Publisher software in mind. That means it will 
product databases and views instead of Magento targets.

Extensions are not compatible with each other and there is no way to upgrade 
from old one to new one. It's highly advised to remove old extension prior 
to installation of new one.
