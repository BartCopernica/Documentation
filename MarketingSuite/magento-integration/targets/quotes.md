# Magento quotes list

Quotes list provides targets that are quotes/baskets. Note that only quotes that 
have access to email address will be synchronized. Another note is that every 
order is also a quote.

Each mailing target is a [Magento Quote](#/menu/documentation/magento/quote).

Quotes list can have following filter options:
* **Active/inactive**
* **Customer Id**
* **Quantity**
* **Weight**
* **Total weight**
* **Chosen product**
* **Product's category**
* **Web store**
* **Currency**
* **IP address** 
* **Last modification date**
* **Finalized**
* **Empty/with items**
