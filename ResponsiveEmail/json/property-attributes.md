# Property `attributes`

The API allows you to specify, add or overwrite attributes for the HTML elements 
in your document. The attributes specified in your JSON will be directly copied 
by the API to the element. You must thus be aware that it might break the email 
lay-out or responsiveness in some clients.  

### Specify HTML attributes on the email template outer body table

The outer wrapper table acts like the HTML body of your email. Most email clients
will strip out the `<body>` tag. That's why most HTML emails, including the emails
generated with this API, have a 100% * 100% outer wrapper table. This enables you 
for instance to change the background color surrounding the email, by adding the 
property `attributes` to the top-level of your JSON document. 

```javascript
{
    "templateName" : "My Template", 
    "attributes" : {
        "background" : "red"
    } 
}
```

### HTML attributes for the inner wrapper table

Emails generated by the responsiveemail.com API have a fixed width of 580px and 
are centered on the screen. It is possible to specify HTML attributes for this 
580px wrapper table, by setting the property `attributes` inside the `content` 
property. The attributes will be directly set on the inner `<td>` of this table. 

```javascript
{
    "content" : {
        "attributes" : {
            "cellspacing" : "5",
            "cellpadding" : "10"
        }
    }
}
```

### HTML attributes for individual content blocks

The property `attributes` is also available for each block within the content 
section of your document. The attributes will be directly applied to the element 
customary for this type of block. For instance, in an image block, the css 
specified within `css` will be directy applied to the html `<img>` tag. 

```javascript
{
    "type" : "image",
    "css" : {
        "margin-right" : "10px",
        "border" : "2px dashed pink"
    }
}
```
