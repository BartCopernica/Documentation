<h1>Introduction to the JSON documentation</h1>

<p>
    The ResponsiveEmail.com API accepts JSON objects as input, and turns these 
    objects into responsive emails.
</p>
<p>
    The properties of the email are set in the JSON document. This includes MIME
    headers, alternate versions and optional email attachments. Of course, the
    most important properties are the ones that describe what your email should
    eventually look like: the texts and images that you want to include, and the
    layout of the email.
<p>
<p>
    <div class="info-bar info">
        <strong>New to JSON?</strong> <a href="http://www.json.org/">Anything you need to know about JSON &rarr;</a>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    To give you an idea, the following JSON object contains a simple email with
    just some text:
</p>


````json
{
    "subject" : "Example document",
    "text" : "This message will show up for clients which are text only.",
    "from" : {
        "address" : "example@responsiveemail.com",
        "name" : "Example"
    },
    "background" : {
        "color" : "white"
    },
    "content" : {
        "blocks" : [{
            "type" : "text",
            "content" : "This is just an example text block."
        }]
    }
}
````


<div class="row-12">
    <div class="cols-6 gutter-small">
        <h2>Top level properties</h2>
        <p>
            As you can probably guess from the first example, there are many different properties,
            e.g. <code>subject</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>from</code>, that can be set. 
            These objects can even hold arrays and nested data.

    </div>
    <div class="cols-6 gutter-small">
        <h2>The <code>content</code> property</h2>
        <p>
            The structure and design of emails generated with the API is defined inside the property `content`.
            Here you can add the blocks that will form your responsive email, based on a 12 columns grid system.

## The content block types

Emails generated by the ResponsiveEmail.com API are built with blocks. You can use text blocks
for adding textual content, image blocks for images, columns blocks to split your content
into multiple responsive columns and many more.

## Example
Add an image



````json
{
  "subject" : "Example document",
  "text" : "This message will show up for clients which are text only.",
  "from" : {
    "address" : "example@responsiveemail.com",
    "name" : "Example"
  },
  "content" : {
    "blocks" : [{
      "type" : "image",
      "src"  : "http://placekitten.com/200/140"
      }]
  }
}
````


## Output

<table class="responsive-output">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="//placekitten.com/200/140" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
