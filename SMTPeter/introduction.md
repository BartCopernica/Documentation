# Introduction

## What is SMTPeter?

SMTPeter is a cloud-based SMTP server for fast and secure email delivery. It 
is designed to help your applications and websites send email messages. From
transactional email messages to mass mailings, we will take care of 
all of the technical and delivery details, so you can focus on creating 
and optimizing your email messages. 

Of course, there is more to SMTPeter than just delivering your email messages. We can track 
opens, clicks and bounces, and you can create fully responsive emails using our 
[ResponsiveEmail service](https://www.responsiveemail.com "ResponsiveEmail website"). 
All statistics and created templates can be found in your [ResponsiveEmail Dashboard](https://www.responsiveemail.com/https://www.responsiveemail.com/app/ "ResponsiveEmail Dashboard").

## Who is SMTPeter for?

SMTPeter is for anyone looking for enterprise level of email delivery.
Whether they are transactional or marketing emails, SMTPeter is made
to deliver large volumes of email messages on demand.

## Connecting with SMTPeter

SMTPeter proves two ways to send email: through our SMTP API or our REST API. 

The [SMTP API](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/api-documentation/smtp-api) makes it 
easy to integrate SMTPeter with any exising application. 
Simply modify your SMTP configuration to use SMTPeter and you are ready to send. 

The [REST API](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/api-documentation/rest-api), ads more control, speed
and configuration options to the integration. Allowing for a deeper and
more advanced integration with our email delivery service.
