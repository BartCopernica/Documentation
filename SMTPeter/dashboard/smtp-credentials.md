# SMTP credentials

In order to connect to SMTPeter through SMTP you will need to create 
an SMTP username and password. These credentials can be created and 
found in the SMTP credentials tab on your SMTPeter dashboard. 

The SMTP credentials are generated automatically and can have 
certain [features of SMTPeter](copernica-docs:SMTPeter/features "SMTPeter features") 
enabled or disabled. You can create multiple logins with different 
features enabled. The overview will show which features are enabled 
for each login. 

 > **Note:** Your SMTP password will only be shown once when you generate
 your login credentials,  make sure to keep it somewhere safe. 

## Using multiple SMTP credentials

You can create multiple logins to enable or disable certain features. 
If, for example, you want to track clicks, opens and bounces, but do not want to
inline your CSS for one set of emails, but do want to use all features with 
for another, you can create a separate login. All emails sent with a login, will 
only use the features enabled for that login.
