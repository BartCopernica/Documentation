<h1>Using SMTPeter</h1>

<p>
    To use SMTPeter, your software must support the SMTP protocol,
    have support for TLS and support authentication.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Host</dt>
    <dd>mail.smtpeter.com

    <dt>Port</dt>
    <dd>25</dd>

    <dt>Encryption</dt>
    <dd>STARTTLS</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Your software must be configured to login using either the
    SMTP AUTH PLAIN or SMTP AUTH LOGIN method with one of your
    <a href="/app/#/admin/smtp-credentials">SMTP credentials</a>
</p>

<h2>Setup SENDER ID</h2>

<p>
    If you utilise SPF for a domain you would like to send mail
    from through SMTPeter, you should include the SMTPeter
    IP-addresses to make sure the mail is not regarded as spam.
</p>

<p>
    To make this easier (and since the IP-addresses that SMTPeter
    sends from can change), we have set up a SPF record that can
    be included, so you automatically keep the latest - and correct -
    version.
</p>

<p>
    To include all the SMTPeter IP-addresses, add the following
    TXT - and if possible SPF - record on your domain.
</p>

<pre><code>"v=spf1 include:_senderspf.smtpeter.com a mx ~all"</code></pre>

<p>
    Of course, you can also allow your own IP addresses. For more
    information, view the <a href="http://www.openspf.org/">OpenSPF website</a>
