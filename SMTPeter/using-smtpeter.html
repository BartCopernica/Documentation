<h1>Using SMTPeter</h1>

<p>
    Using SMTPeter is very simple, it works exactly like any
    normal mailserver would do - e.g. that of an I.S.P.
</p>

<p>
    Because of this, SMTPeter could be used through standard
    desktop email programs like Thunderbird, Evolution or
    Apple Mail.
</p>

<p>
    To send mail through SMTPeter, configure your chosen
    e-mail client with the following settings:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Host</dt>
    <dd>mail.smtpeter.com

    <dt>Port</dt>
    <dd>25</dd>

    <dt>Encryption</dt>
    <dd>STARTTLS</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    To prevent spam from being sent, we require authentication
    before being allowed to send out messages. To authenticate
    with SMTPeter, configure your client to authenticate either
    using AUTH PLAIN or AUTH LOGIN.
</p>

<h2>Using SMTPeter as a smart host</h2>

<p>
    If you are already using an MTA and want to avoid changing
    the way that different applications send out mail, the MTA
    could likely be configured to use SMTPeter as a smart host.
</p>

<p>
    In a smart host setup, your application still connects to
    the already existing MTA. The MTA will then - instead of
    directly delivering the mail itself - deliver it to
    SMTPeter.
<p>

<p>
    This way, you get the best of both worlds. Connect times
    are very low (because the MTA is likely local), which is
    ideal when making many connections for single mail delivery,
    while SMTPeter takes care of the actual email delivery,
    throttling according to the speed of the receiving mail
    server.

<h2>Setup SENDER ID</h2>

<p>
    If you utilise SPF for a domain you would like to send mail
    from through SMTPeter, you should include the SMTPeter
    IP-addresses to make sure the mail is not regarded as spam.
</p>

<p>
    To make this easier (and since the IP-addresses that SMTPeter
    sends from can change), we have set up a SPF record that can
    be included, so you automatically keep the latest - and correct -
    version.
</p>

<p>
    To include all the SMTPeter IP-addresses, add the following
    TXT - and if possible SPF - record on your domain.
</p>

<pre><code>"v=spf1 include:_senderspf.smtpeter.com a mx ~all"</code></pre>

<p>
    Of course, you can also allow your own IP addresses. For more
    information, view the <a href="http://www.openspf.org/">OpenSPF website</a>
