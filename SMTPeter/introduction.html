<h2>Becoming a "trusted" sender</h2>
	<p>
		Here at SMTPeter we have a strong anti-spam policy. Bylimiting the amount of emails an account can send 
		at first, we keep malicious users from damaging our IP reputation with spam. It also allows us to ensure
		the highest possible delivery rate. There are two ways to become a trusted sender. One way is to:
		choose to use one or more <a href="#" title="using dedicated IP addresses">dedicated IP addresses</a>. All your emails (and only your emails!) will go over those
		IP addresses, giving you control over your own IP reputation. The other way is simple as well: fill out this form/send us an email stating you 
	</p>

		<strong>Warning!</strong> if we do find you send SPAM we will immediately stop delivering your emails and close your account. No refunds will be given.
