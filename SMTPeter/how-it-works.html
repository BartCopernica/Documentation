<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<p>
    When sending an e-mail, the mail has to be delivered to the recipients mail
    server. For example: if you send an email to user@gmail.com, a connection is
    made to one of Googles email servers to deliver the mail. An email sent to
    user@live.com will be delivered to Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
    All these mail senders have their own configuration. They may e.g. limit
    the number of messages that may be delivered over a single connection,
    how many connections may be opened from a single I.P. address. They may
    also keep an eye on IP addresses that suddenly send a lot of mails when
    they did not use to do so in the past and mark these mails as spam.
</p>

<p>
    When using SMTPeter you don't have to worry about this at all. You simply
    deliver your mail to SMTPeter and we take care of the rest. We make sure
    to connect to the right server, and that the addresses we send from have
    a reputation sufficient to avoid getting marked as spam. If the receiving
    server can not handle the flow of messages, we throttle back delivery.
