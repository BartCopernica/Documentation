<h1>Function MQ_SmtpSend</h1>
<p>
    Send raw data directly to the SMTP connection.
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ takes care of its own output buffering, so you can be sure
    that all data is always delivered, unless the connection is 
    suddenly closed by the peer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Watch out!</strong> MailerQ normally takes care of performing
    all steps in the SMTP protocol. If you start sending data yourself,
    the SMTP connection may end up in an invalid state.
