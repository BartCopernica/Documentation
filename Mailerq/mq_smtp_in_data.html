<h1>Function mq_smtp_in_data</h1>
<p>
    Function that can be implemented by a plugin and that is called by
    MailerQ every time a MIME message is received over a SMTP connection
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
bool mq_smtp_in_data(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context, <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> *connection, const char *mime, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
