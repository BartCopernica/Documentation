<h1>Function mq_smtp_in_secure</h1>
<p>
    When an incoming SMTP connection is turned into a secure SMTP
    connection, MailerQ will call the <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_secure">
    mq_smtp_in_secure()</a> function in the plugins. This function
    is called <i>after</i> the connection is secured, so you can be
    sure that the passed in connection object is guaranteed to be secure.
</p>
<p>
    Your function should return true if you want your plugin to take over 
    control from MailerQ, or false if control should stay with MailerQ.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
bool mq_smtp_in_secure(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context, <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> *connection);
</pre>
<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
