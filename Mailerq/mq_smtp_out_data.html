<h1>Function mq_smtp_out_data()</h1>
<p>
    If your plugin contains this function, it will be called as soon as
    the SMTP connection enters the data state, giving you the chance to
    manipulate the message body before it is sent.
</p>
<p>
    Normally, the full MIME messages that are going to be sent by
    MailerQ are stored in the JSON objects that are loaded from RabbitMQ.
    When a SMTP connection has been set up, the MIME is extracted from
    the JSON and sent over the SMTP connection.
</p>
<p>
    But you may write a plugin that does this in a different way. If you
    want to write a plugin to generate the MIME in a different fashion,
    you can do so by implementing the mq_smtp_out_data() function. This
    function is called by MailerQ after the SMTP connection has been
    set up, to load the actual MIME message.
</p>
<p>
    This method is designed to run asynchronously. You should not execute
    any blocking calls from within this function, if you do you will disturb
    other active connections resulting in timeouts.

<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
