<h1>Sending responsive emails with MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ reads messages from a RabbitMQ message queue, and expects
    these messages to be formatted in JSON format. Every JSON message
    should at least have the following three properties:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>envelope</li>
    <li>recipient</li>
    <li>mime</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The "mime" property in the JSON can either be a full valid MIME string, or 
    (if your license allows you to use this feature) a nested
    JSON object that contains the email content. If it is a string, MailerQ
    will just send the MIME message "as is" to the recipient. But when it is
    a nested object, MailerQ uses the "Responsive
    Email" algorithm to create a fully responsive email on the fly.
</p>
<h2>Example content</h2>
<p>
    If you use the responsive email feature, the "mime" property of the
    JSON may be a nested object. In this object you can use all
    the properties that are documented on the 
    <a href="https://www.responsiveemail.com/support/json/introduction"
    title="ResponsiveEmail.com documentation">ResponsiveEmail.com</a>
    website. To give you an idea of what is possible, check the
    following input:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre><code>{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": {
        "from": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
        "to": "info@example.org",
        "subject": "Example subject",
        "textVersion": "This is the example message text",
        "headers": {
            "x-my-special-header": "special-value"
        },
        "content": {
            "blocks": [ {
                "type": "image",
                "src": "http://www.example.com/logo.png"
            }, {
                "type": "feed",
                "source": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss"
            }, {
                "type": "button",
                "label": "Click the button!",
                "link": {
                    "url": "http://www.mailerq.com"
                }
            } ]
        },
        "attachments": [ {
            "url": "http://www.example.com/a-special-file.pdf",
            "name": "brochure.pdf"
        } ]
    }
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    The above example is just a quick overview of what type of JSON is
    supported. The engine is very powerful, and the example only uses a
    small subset of all the features. MailerQ can processes this type of JSON,
    and downloads the necessary resources (like the RSS feed and the attachments,
    and even the image if it is necessary to find out the image size) to 
    construct a HTML email that is fully responsive and that works
    on all kinds of devices.

<p>
    To get a better idea of what is possible and to see more examples
    of the type of input JSON that is recognized, go to the
    <a href="https://responsiveemail.com">ResponsiveEmail.com</a> website.
    You will also find a nice <b>drag and drop</b> editor over there that can
    be used to design your emails.
</p>
<h2>Embedded algorithm</h2>
<p>
    Some users think that MailerQ makes a connection to the ResponsiveEmail.com 
    web service to transform the JSON into MIME. This is not the case. MailerQ and
    ResponsiveEmail.com are both products from the same company, and we
    have simply embedded the entire ResponsiveEmail.com algorithm in MailerQ.
    MailerQ can run this algorithm natively, and does not have to make
    any calls to the ResponsiveEmail.com web service. You therefore do not 
    need a ResponsiveEmail.com API key to use this feature.
