<h1>Function mq_smtp_in_connect</h1>
<p>
    When MailerQ receives an incoming SMTP connection, it will
    accept that connection, and iterate over all loaded plugins,
    and call the <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_connect">
    mq_smtp_in_connect()</a> function in each of these plugins.
</p>
<p>
    You can implement this function in your plugin if you want to
    run certain code right after an incoming TCP connection comes
    in on the SMTP port of MailerQ. Your function should return true
    if you want your plugin to take over control from MailerQ, or
    false if control should stay with MailerQ.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
bool mq_smtp_in_connect(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context, <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> *connection);
</pre>
<p>
    The function takes two parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> structure with information about the event loop</li>
    <li>A <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> structure with information about the connection</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
