<h1>Getting started with MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ relies on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> for its
    message queues. RabbitMQ is a server application that deals with message
    queue'ing. Before you're going to install and configure MailerQ, you
    must therefore first make sure you have access to a working RabbitMQ 
    server. If you have a working and up-to-date RabbitMQ server, you
    can proceed with setting up MailerQ. Otherwise, check our 
    <a href="/documentation/rabbitmq">RabbitMQ tips and trics article</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="installing-mailerq">Installing MailerQ</h2>
<p>
    After you've installed your RabbitMQ server, you can proceed with setting
    up MailerQ. Installing the MailerQ Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) on a Linux 
    server is easy. We have <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">
    downloads</a> for Debian based environments (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) and for 
    Red Hat based environments (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, etc). 
</p>
<p>
    After you have <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">downloaded</a> 
    the appropriate MailerQ .deb or .rpm file, you can install it on your system. 
    This can probably be achieved by double-clicking on it if you have a desktop
    computer, or with one of the following command line instructions:
</p>
<h2>Red Hat based environments:</h2>
<div class="codeBox">
    <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><strong>$</strong> sudo rpm -i /path/to/mailerq-version.rpm</code></pre>
</div>
<h2>Debian based environments:</h2>
<div class="codeBox">
    <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><strong>$</strong> sudo dpkg -i path/to/mailerq-version.deb</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    Now MailerQ is installed on your system. The MTA can be started
    by entering the "mailerq" command on the command line. But 
    before you do this, you probably want to make some changes to
    the configuration file.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration">
    MailerQ configuration file</a> can be found in the "/etc/mailerq" 
    directory and is named "config.txt". It holds many options that you 
    should set before you can start mailerq. The most important options 
    are the address and login credentials of your RabbitMQ message broker 
    and your license key. We have documented 
    <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration">
    all supported configuration options</a>. A number of options require
    special attention.
</p>
<h3>RabbitMQ configuration</h3>
<p>
    The most important settings in the config file of course deal with
    RabbitMQ. The hostname of the RabbitMQ server, and the names of the 
    exchanges and queues should all be specified in the config file. MailerQ
    helps you in setting up the RabbitMQ configuration: if you include a 
    queue or exchange in the config file that does not yet exist, it will
    automatically be created by MailerQ.
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind that all results are also published to RabbitMQ. If you
    run MailerQ in production, this could result in queues that are built
    up rappidly. To prevent that your RabbitMQ server runs out of resources,
    you either have to ensure that you periodically clean these queues,
    or you should configure MailerQ not to publish results.
</p>
<h3>Database configuration</h3>
<p>
    Besides the <i>essential</i> settings to connect to RabbitMQ, you
    probably also want to connect to a SQL database. Such a database is
    used by MailerQ to store the configuration of email throttling settings, 
    DKIM keys, flood patterns and any other delivery settings. By default,
    MailerQ sets up a SQlite database for these settings. However, MySQL 
    and PostgreSQL are faster and better suited for high performance servers.
</p>
<p>
    If you are happy to use the standard SQLite database you do not need to 
    change any of the settings in the database configuration file. If you 
    want MailerQ to store the settings in a different database , you will 
    have to specify the database address. You can find more information on 
    how to do so in the database configuration settings.
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ automatically creates or alters missing or incomplete tables. If 
    you use a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, you should ensure that the specified 
    database is already created, and that MailerQ has enough privileges to 
    create and modify tables. For a SQLite database you only have to make sure 
    that the database file is writable.
</p>
<p>
    You must also make sure that you've installed the necessary database 
    libraries on your system so that MailerQ can actually <i>connect</i> to 
    the database. If you use the default SQLite database, you must ensure 
    that the sqlite3 library is installed on your server. For MySQL you need 
    the mysqlclient or mariadbclient library, and for PostgreSql you need to 
    pq library.
</p>
<h3>DKIM signing</h3>
<p>
    MailerQ can sign emails with DKIM keys. However, to do this, MailerQ
    uses then 'opendkim' library. You must make sure that this library
    is installed on your system. If it is missing, no DKIM signatures
    can be created.
</p>
<h3>License file</h3>
<p>
    The configuration file also holds a reference to a license file. After 
    creating a MailerQ account, you can <a href="/product/license">download 
    a license from this website</a>. If you have questions about your
    license, feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:info@mailerq.com">info@mailerq.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>
    Now you're ready to get started. Enter "mailerq" on the command
    line and your MTA is running.
</p>
<div class="codeBox">
    <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><strong>$</strong> mailerq</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    MailerQ comes with a web based 
    <a href="http://www.mailerq.com/documentation/management-console" 
    title="An MTA with a management console">management console</a> 
    that you can use to monitor exactly what is happening. This MTA console
    can be opened from your browser. The port number and password
    can be set in the <a href="/documentation/configuration" 
    title="MailerQ configuration">config file</a>. The default 
    location is http://your-server-name:8485.
</p>
<p>
    To start sending mails with MailerQ, you need 
    <a href="/documentation/send-email" title="Send emails with MailerQ">
    to publish an e-mail to the appropriate message queue</a> in RabbitMQ or 
    use one of our <a href="/documentation/mailerq-examples" title="MailerQ examples">examples</a>.
