            <span itemprop="description"><span itemprop="name">MailerQ</span> comes equipped with a full <span itemprop="applicationCategory">MTA</span> management console. The management
            console allows you to monitor the performance of your email delivery 
            in real-time. If necessary, the management console can be used to
            change settings to maximize deliverability on the fly. If you have multiple instances of MailerQ
            running in a cluster you can easily switch between them.</span>

    <h2>Domains</h2>
        <p>
            Not every domain likes to receive email at high rates. The domains view provides real-time information on
             per-domain performance e.g. queues or failed deliveries. Use this info to make adjustments on the fly for 
             example modify email throttle settings.

    <h2>Email throttling</h2>
        <p>
            Setting up email throttling can be done in the MailerQ Management Console. All throttling settings can be 
            adjusted in real-time, making it easy to improve your email delivery when needed. You can choose to 
            set up throttling settings for a single domain for all IP addresses or for all IP addresses.

        <h2>Flood patterns</h2>
        <p>
            Flood patterns are rules that override the default throttling settings of MailerQ when the 
            Mail Transfer Agent receives a specific error from a receiving mail server.

    <h2>Paused deliveries</h2>

            The paused deliveries tab in the Management Console of our Mail Transfer Agent shows you exactly what email
            deliveries are currently paused. It shows which IP address is paused to which remote IP/domain and until when the delivery is paused. You can also manually pause email deliveries if necessary.

            Email deliveriy can also be redirected from one IP to another IP. For example when one of your IPs is 
            greylisted by a receiving domain. The redirected delivery shows all redirecting rules and which 
            delivery is currently being redirected. You can also manually set up redirections.

    <h2>Live SMTP monitor using web sockets</h2>
        <p>
            One of MailerQ's cool features (if we may say so) is the live SMTP monitor. 
            By starting up the monitor in the management console, your browser opens
            a <a href="http://www.websocket.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HTML 5 websocket</a> to the core
            MailerQ process. All SMTP traffic received and sent out by MailerQ is 
            also sent to this websocket, so you can exactly keep an eye on what is
            happening to your mailings.
