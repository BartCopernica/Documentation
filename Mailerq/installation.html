<h1>Getting started with MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ relies on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> for its
    message queues. RabbitMQ is a server application that deals with message
    queue'ing. Before you're going to install and configure MailerQ, you
    must therefore first make sure you have access to a working RabbitMQ 
    server. If you have a working and up-to-date RabbitMQ server, you
    can proceed with setting up MailerQ. Otherwise, check our RabbitMQ tips 
    and trics article.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="/documentation/rabbitmq"><strong>Tips and trics RabbitMQ</strong></a>.
</p>
<p>
    (In fact: even if you already have a RabbitMQ server, you also might
    check this above article - just to be sure)
</p>
<h2 id="installing-mailerq">Installing MailerQ</h2>
<p>
    After you've installed your RabbitMQ server, you can proceed with setting
    up MailerQ. Installing the MailerQ Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) on a Linux 
    server is easy. We have <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">
    downloads</a> for Debian based environments (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) and for 
    Red Hat based environments (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, etc). 
</p>
<p>
    After you have <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">downloaded</a> 
    the appropriate MailerQ .deb or .rpm file, you can install it on your system. 
    This can probably be achieved by double-clicking on it if you have a desktop
    computer, or with one of the following command line instructions:
</p>
<h2>Red Hat based environments:</h2>
<pre><strong>$</strong> sudo rpm -i /path/to/mailerq-version.rpm</pre>

<h2>Debian based environments:</h2>

<div class="codeBox">
    <pre><strong>$</strong> sudo dpkg -i path/to/mailerq-version.deb</pre>
</div>
<p>
    Now MailerQ is installed on your system. The MTA can be started by entering 
    the "mailerq" command on the command line. But before you do this, you 
    probably want to make some changes to the configuration file.
</p>
<h2>Configuration file and license</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration">MailerQ 
    configuration file</a> can be found in the "/etc/mailerq"
    directory and is named "config.txt". It holds many options that
    you should set before you can start mailerq. The most important
    options are the address and login credentials of your RabbitMQ
    message broker and your license key. We have documented
    <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration" >all supported 
    configuration options</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The configuration file also holds a reference to a license file. After creating a MailerQ
    account, you can download a license <a href="/product/license" title="MailerQ license">from this 
    website</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to renew your license either monthly or annually. License pricing
    varies based on the renewal period and amount of IP addresses you use. If you 
    have any questions feel free to send an email to <a href="maito:info@mailerq.com">info@mailerq.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>
    Now you're ready to get started. Enter "mailerq" on the command
    line and your MTA is running.
</p>
<div class="codeBox">
    <pre><strong>$</strong> mailerq</pre>
</div>
<p>
    MailerQ comes with a web based 
    <a href="http://www.mailerq.com/documentation/management-console" 
    title="An MTA with a management console">management console</a> 
    that you can use to monitor exactly what is happening. This MTA console
    can be opened from your browser. The port number and password
    can be set in the <a href="/documentation/configuration" 
    title="MailerQ configuration">config file</a>. The default 
    location is http://your-server-name:8485.
</p>
<p>
    To start sending mails with MailerQ, you need 
    <a href="/documentation/send-email" title="Send emails with MailerQ">
        to publish an e-mail to the appropriate message queue</a> in 
        RabbitMQ or use one of our  
        <a href="/documentation/mailerq-examples" title="MailerQ examples">examples</a>.
