<h1>Getting started with MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ relies on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> for its
    message queues. RabbitMQ is a server application that deals with message
    queue'ing. Before you're going to install and configure MailerQ, you
    must therefore first make sure you have access to a working RabbitMQ 
    server.

</p>
<p>
    If you have a running RabbitMQ server, you can <a href="#installing-mailerq">
    proceed with installing</a> MailerQ. Make sure you know the login and password 
    for your RabbitMQ server, because MailerQ needs them for connecting to RabbitMQ.
</p>
<p>
    If you're completely new to RabbitMQ, there are a couple of things that might
    need attention:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div><strong>Login and password</strong></div>
        The default login-password combination only works if you connect from localhost. 
        If you install RabbitMQ and MailerQ on a different servers, you either have to 
        change the default "guest/guest" password to something else, or set the 'loopback_users'
        option in the RabbitMQ configuration (see <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html">
        https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><strong>Management plugin</strong></div>
        RabbitMQ has a plugin that adds a cool web interface to it. We recommend that 
        you install this plugin, so that you can use your webbrowser to control your 
        RabbitMQ instance. (see <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html">
        https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <div><strong>Don't run out of resources</strong></div>
        MailerQ not only uses RabbitMQ to fetch the message that it is going to send, but
        also (if you have this configured) to publish back the delivery results. If you
        do not process these delivery results, you run the risk that your RabbitMQ server
        runs out of resources.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installing-mailerq">Installing MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    Installing the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) MailerQ on a Linux server is easy. We have 
    <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">downloads</a> for Debian based environments 
    (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) and for Red Hat based environments (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, etc). 
    Before you start the installation of MailerQ, make sure that you have 
    access to a working <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
    RabbitMQ message broker</a> (version 3.3.1+), because that's what MailerQ uses for storing
    all e-mails.
</p>
<p>
    After you have <a href="/product/download" title="Download MailerQ">downloaded</a> 
    the appropriate MailerQ .deb or .rpm file,
    you can install it on your system. This can probably be
    achieved by double-clicking on it if you have a desktop
    computer, or with one of the following command line instructions:
</p>
<h2>Red Hat based environments:</h2>
<pre><strong>$</strong> sudo rpm -i /path/to/mailerq-version.rpm</pre>

<h2>Debian based environments:</h2>

<div class="codeBox">
    <pre><strong>$</strong> sudo dpkg -i path/to/mailerq-version.deb</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Now MailerQ is installed on your system. The MTA can be started
    by entering the "mailerq" command on the command line. But 
    before you do this, you probably want to make some changes to
    the configuration file.
</p>
<h2>Configuration file and license</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration">MailerQ 
    configuration file</a> can be found in the "/etc/mailerq"
    directory and is named "config.txt". It holds many options that
    you should set before you can start mailerq. The most important
    options are the address and login credentials of your RabbitMQ
    message broker and your license key. We have documented
    <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration" >all supported 
    configuration options</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The configuration file also holds a reference to a license file. After creating a MailerQ
    account, you can download a license <a href="/product/license" title="MailerQ license">from this 
    website</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to renew your license either monthly or annually. License pricing
    varies based on the renewal period and amount of IP addresses you use. If you 
    have any questions feel free to send an email to <a href="maito:info@mailerq.com">info@mailerq.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<p>
    Now you're ready to get started. Enter "mailerq" on the command
    line and your MTA is running.
</p>
<div class="codeBox">
    <pre><strong>$</strong> mailerq</pre>
</div>
<p>
    MailerQ comes with a web based 
    <a href="http://www.mailerq.com/documentation/management-console" 
    title="An MTA with a management console">management console</a> 
    that you can use to monitor exactly what is happening. This MTA console
    can be opened from your browser. The port number and password
    can be set in the <a href="/documentation/configuration" 
    title="MailerQ configuration">config file</a>. The default 
    location is http://your-server-name:8485.
</p>
<p>
    To start sending mails with MailerQ, you need 
    <a href="/documentation/send-email" title="Send emails with MailerQ">
        to publish an e-mail to the appropriate message queue</a> in 
        RabbitMQ or use one of our  
        <a href="/documentation/mailerq-examples" title="MailerQ examples">examples</a>.
