<h1>How to send emails from MailerQ</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ is an MTA that uses an AMQP message queue as its outbox. It loads JSON
    encoded messages from this message queue, sends them out over an SMTP
    connection, and then publishes the <a href="/documentation/result-queue" 
    title="MailerQ result queue">JSON encoded result</a> back to one or more result 
    queues, where other programs or scripts can pick them up.
</p>
<p>
    Sending email with MailerQ can be done in three different ways, you can
    either:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>write a program or script that <a href="/documentation/send-email#Amqp" title="AMQP">directly adds
    a JSON encoded email</a> to the outbox message queue</li>
    <li>use MailerQ's <a href="/documentation/send-email#Smtp" title="SMTP">built-in SMTP server</a></li>
    <li>use MailerQ to <a href="/documentation/send-email#Cli">read messages from standard input</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Amqp">Post email directly to the AMQP message queue</h2>
<p>
    Because MailerQ fetches all messages from a RabbitMQ message queue, the fastest
    way to inject emails is by having your application publish the mails
    directly to RabbitMQ. This is not difficult. After all, JSON is a
    <a href="http://www.json.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">widely known data format</a> that can be
    easily created and processed by almost every programming language there is,
    and the message queue can be easily accessed (add messages, remove messages)
    using the AMQP protocol, for which also
    <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">many plugins and libraries</a>
    are available. To help you out, we <a href="/documentation/mailerq-examples" title="MailerQ examples">
    created a few examples</a> for commonly used languages.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/Resources/Images/mailerq-put-it-in-rabbitmq.png" alt="MailerQ put it in RabbitMQ"/>
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, if you publish the messages directly to a message queue,
    your script will be faster (publishing to AMQP is fast), and you can use
    special features that are not available when you use SMTP.
</p>
<h3>Sending messages</h3>
<p>
    As we mentioned above, to send out emails with the MailerQ MTA, you can simply
    add a message to the outbox message queue. This JSON encoded message should
    contain a minimum of three fields that hold the envelope email address,
    recipient's email address and full MIME message.
</p>
<p>
    <div><strong>Minimal requirements for a JSON encoded email</strong></div>
    <ul>
        <li>The envelope email address from which the message is sent</li>
        <li>The destination address</li>
        <li>The full message MIME. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    That's it. In short, the minimal JSON encoded message to put in the
    queue therefore looks like this:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "From: my-sender-address@my-domain.com\r\n
             To: info@example.org\r\n
             Subject:Example subject\r\n\r\n
             This is the example message text"
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Note that for ease of reading we added some spaces to the message 
    mime in the above example. 
</p>
<p>
    If your MailerQ license allows this, you can also assign nested JSON 
    objects to the "mime" field. MailerQ detects whether you set a string or
    nested object, and will in the latter case process this nested
    structure, and create a full MIME out of it:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": {
        "from": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
        "to": "info@example.org",
        "subject": "Example subject",
        "textVersion": "This is the example message text"
    }
}
       </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ uses the same algorithm for turning JSON into full blown MIME messages 
    as the <a href="https://www.responsiveemail.com">responsiveemail.com</a> web service,
    but without having to make any calls to this web service. 
    The algorithm is completely embedded in MailerQ. This feature allows you to 
    send HTML mails without having to worry about the layout and responsiveness
    of your email: you only supply JSON and the HTML mails are automatically 
    generated by MailerQ.
</p>
<p>
    In the example we only used the "from", "to", "subject" and "textVersion"
    properties to create a very simple MIME message. Besides these properties however,
    MailerQ recognizes much more properties that allow you to add HTML code, 
    include images, attachments, RSS feeds -- and much more. To read more
    about this, please read our documentation about 
    <a href="/documentation/responsive-email">creating responsive emails with MailerQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
    As we said, you need a special license to use this "responsive email" feature. If you
    do not have such a special license, you can of course still inject emails
    in the message queue, but will have to create the MIME string
    yourself, and you can only assign strings to the JSON "mime" property.
</p>

<h2 id="Smtp">Using the built-in SMTP server</h2>
<p>
    If you do not want to inject mails directly into the RabbitMQ message queue,
    you can also send emails to the SMTP port that is opened by MailerQ.
    All messages sent to this port are received by MailerQ and are automatically
    published to a message queue, where they will then be picked up and delivered to
    the recipients.
</p>
<p>
    In MailerQ's <a href="/documentation/configuration" title="MailerQ configuration" >config file</a> you
    can set to which queue emails received by MailerQ are published. Most
    users set this to the same value as the outbox queue, so that all received
    emails are automatically published to the outbox queue, from which they are
    then directly picked up again and scheduled for immediate forwarding.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/Resources/Images/mailerq-shared-inbox-outbox-queue.png" alt="MailerQ shared inbox outbox queue"/>
</p>
<p>
    Because MailerQ stores all incoming mails first in a message queue, you
    can add intermediate scripts that process the messages before they
    are forwarded. If you want to add a script that does additional processing
    or filtering before a message is forwarded, you can configure MailerQ
    to publish the received mails in an inbox queue, and write your
    own scripts that read the messages from this inbox queue, process or filter
    them, and that post the messages to the outbox queue where MailerQ
    can pick them up and deliver them.
</p>
<p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/Resources/Images/mailerq-seperate-inbox-outbox-queues.png" alt="MailerQ seperate inbox outbox queues"/>
</p>
<h3>SMTP and multiple IP addresses</h3>
<p>
    If you run MailerQ on a server with multiple IP addresses, the SMTP server
    is available on all those addresses too. You can thus choose to which IP address
    to send your mail. MailerQ recognizes the IP address to which the mail was originally
    submitted, stores that information in the JSON message, and when the mail is
    finally forwarded to the internet, it will be sent out from
    <i>exactly the same</i> IP address.
    You should be aware that this can cause problems if you deliver your email
    to an IP address from which no external connections can be made (like
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">127.0.0.1</a>).
</p>
<p>
    If you want MailerQ to send out the mail from a different IP address than that
    you originally sent it to, you can include <a href="/documentation/send-email#localips">an extra mime header field</a> that
    instructs MailerQ to use a different IP instead.
</p>
<h2 id="Cli">MailerQ as command line utility</h2>
<p>
    The MailerQ program can be started in two different modes: as a daemon
    process that runs all the time and that sends out the messages, or as a
    command line utility that reads
    a message from standard input and publishes it to the inbox queue. As
    a command line utility, MailerQ does not attempt to send out the mail -
    it only puts the message in the RabbitMQ message queue. You need a
    seperate running MailerQ daemon process that takes care of the delivery.
</p>
<img class="screenshot" src="/Resources/Images/mailerq-mime-output-stdout.png" alt="MailerQ mime output"/>
<p>
    When you normally start up MailerQ, it operates as a daemon process. To
    start it as a command line utility for reading a message from standard input, you need
    to pass extra arguments to the program; either the email addresses of
    the recipients, or the option '--extract-recipients' to tell MailerQ that
    it should read in a mime message from standard input and filter out the
    destination addresses from it.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq --extract-recipients</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    The message read in by MailerQ is converted into a JSON encoded email
    message and published to the inbox queue. An other MailerQ daemon process
    can then pick it up from there and take care of the delivery.
</p>
<h3>End of message</h3>
<p>
    MailerQ reads in all data from standard input until it encounters a line
    with a single dot on it. It treats this line as the end-of-message marker
    and will publish all data up to this dot (but not including the dot) to
    the inbox message queue.
</p>
<p>
    This could become problematic if your email also contains lines that
    start with a dot. Such lines should of course not be treated as
    end-of-message markers. There are two ways to prevent this; you can either
    stuff those lines with an extra dot in front. MailerQ will automatically
    recognize this and remove the extra dot, or you can add the command line
    option '--ignore-dot' to instruct MailerQ that dots do not have a special
    meaning, and that the message is ended with end-of-file instead.
<p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq --ignore-dot recipient1@example.com recipient2@example.com</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq --ignore-dot --extract-recipients</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3>Envelope address</h3>
<p>
    The envelope address that MailerQ uses for sending out an email
    is automatically filtered from the message MIME (it can be set in the
    custom x-mq-envelope header, or in the return-path header). However, you
    can also set the envelope address manually with the '--envelope' command
    line option.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq --envelope myaddress@mydomain.com --extract-recipients</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3>Message format</h3>
<p>
    Messages that are read from standard input should be in MIME format. The
    headers should be seperated from the message data by a newline, and lines
    should end with either a newline character, or a linefeed+newline character.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre><code>From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Example message
x-mq-maxdelivertime: 2013-05-01 00:00:00

Example email data.
Email data ends when a single dot followed by new line character is send.
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3>Sending emails from file</h3>
<p>
    Because MailerQ reads in messages from standard input, you can use regular unix
    shell pipes and I/O redirection operators for sending mail.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ cat email.txt | mailerq --extract-recipients --ignore-dot</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ mailerq --extract-recipients --ignore-dot < email.txt </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3 id="PhpIni">Using MailerQ in PHP mail() function</h3>
<p>
    The PHP mail() function internally uses a command line utility (for
    example: "sendmail") to send out the mail. By modifying the configuration
    of PHP you can change this into "mailerq", so that all mails
    sent from PHP are automatically delivered by MailerQ.
</p>
<p>
    To use MailerQ for sending emails in PHP using mail() function, set
    property "sendmail_path" in php.ini to:
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre><code>sendmail_path = mailerq --envelope my-sender-address@my-domain.com --extract-recipients --ignore-dot</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h2 id="Properties">Setting additional properties for better delivery control</h2>
<p>
    In the examples that we have so far given, we only demonstrated the
    elementary properties "envelope", "recipient" and "mime".
    But to have better control of delivery, you can set all sort of additional properties too.
    These are properties that for example specify the number of send attempts,
    the max delivery time, the IP addresses to use, et cetera. These properties can
    either be set in the JSON object if you publish mails directly to the outbox
    message queue, or as extra x-mq-* header fields in the MIME message.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the x-mq-* header fields are only processed when you send the mail over
    SMTP to MailerQ or when you use MailerQ as a command line utility. If you
    publish mails directly to the AMQP message queue, the x-mq-* headers will not
    be processed. The headers are removed from the message when the
    mail is converted into a JSON object, and will thus no longer be included
    when the message reaches the final recipient.
</p>
<h3>Envelope address</h3>
<p>
    The envelope address is the address that is used in the 'MAIL FROM'
    communication. It is a required property in the JSON object. If you
    submit a message as MIME (via SMTP or command line), you can set it
    with the x-mq-envelope header.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre><code>x-mq-envelope: my-sender-address@my-domain.com</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "..."
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3>Max delivery time</h3>
<p>
    When a message cannot be delivered immediately because of unresponsive receivers,
    greylisting or throttling, MailerQ publishes back the email to the outbox queue
    for later delivery. This can result in emails that are sent much later than the
    time that you first added them to the message queue.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not want an email to be delivered after a certain time, just add a
    maxdelivertime property.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-maxdelivertime: 2013-02-01 00:00:00</code></pre></div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "maxdelivertime": "2013-02-01 00:00:00"
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Timestamps in MailerQ always are in UTC. And please note that MailerQ is not very
    tolerant in parsing timestamps, so better make sure that you use the right
    formatting (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
</p>
<p>
    If you do not specify an explicit max delivery time, MailerQ will attempt to
    deliver the mail within 24 hours after the mail was first picked up from the outbox.
</p>
<h3>Max number of attempts</h3>
<p>
    Just like a max delivery time, you can also control the max number of attempts
    that MailerQ uses to send out an email. If a first attempt fails because a remote
    server is unreachable or does not immediately accept the message, MailerQ will
    make a new attempt a little later.
</p>
<p>
    By default, MailerQ tries to send out the mail six times. If you want more or
    less attempts, you can specify maxattempts propery:
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-maxattempts: 3</code></pre></div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "maxattempts": 3
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3 id="inlinecss">Inlinize CSS</h3>
<p>
    When you send out HTML emails, you face the problem that not all email
    clients support stylesheets that are set in the header. Some email clients
    (especially web based clients) strip out the CSS code from the HTML header.
    This often messes up the layout and look of your messages.
    To overcome this, it is better not to set CSS settings in the header in
    the first place, but use 'style="..."' attributes in the HTML code instead.
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ can do this automatically. If you set the "inlinecss" property to
    true, MailerQ parses the HTML email, and converts the CSS code from the
    HTML header into inline 'style="..."' attributes in the HTML body.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-inlinecss: true</code></pre></div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "inlinecss": true
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3 id="normalize">Normalize line endings</h3>
<p>
    All lines of the email must be terminated with a linefeed/newline combination:
    \r\n. If you use other line endings (for example only newlines and no
    linefeeds) the email might not get delivered, and DKIM signing might fail.
    However, if you set the property "normalize" to 1, MailerQ will automatically
    convert all line endings to valid linefeed/newline endings.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-normalize: 1</code></pre></div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "normalize": 1
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3 id="localips">Local IP addresses</h3>
<p>
    Some mail servers keep track of the number of parallel connections that are made
    to it - and put limits on the number of connections or deliveries. If your server
    has multiple IPs, MailerQ can send out mail from all those IP addresses at the
    same time so that the receiver does not notice that the connections all come from
    the same source. This can be useful to increase the delivery rate for sending out mail.
</p>
<p>
    By default, MailerQ makes all connections to remote mail servers from the default
    (first) available IP of the host server. If your server has multiple IPs assigned
    to it, you can instruct MailerQ to use a different local IP for sending out the mail.
</p>
<p>
    To try different IP address for sending out the mail, you can add a list of available
    IP addresses:
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-ip: 231.34.13.156
x-mq-ip: 231.34.13.158</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "ips": ["231.34.13.156", "231.34.13.158"]
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ will randomly pick one of the IPs to send out the mail. Be aware that you
    can of course only use addresses that are actually bound to the host that MailerQ
    runs on. Other IP addresses will result in failed deliveries.
</p>

<h3>Storing messages in message store</h3>
<p>
    MIME bodies can become very large, especially if your emails contain attachments
    or embedded content. To prevent that such big messages have to be processed by 
    RabbitMQ, MailerQ can be configured to use MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite
    for the message bodies instead. You can then publish a much smaller JSON
    message to RabbitMQ, and keep the full MIME messages in an external message store.
</p>
<p>
    MailerQ waits with loading the message from message store until the SMTP
    connection has been set up, so that no time and resources are wasted on
    fetching information that is not needed.
</p>
<p>
    In all the given examples we have included the full message data in the
    JSON object. This is probably the best thing to do, as most messages are
    delivered right away, and there would be more overhead in storing messages
    in an external message store. However, if an email has to be rescheduled,
    and is going to be stored in RabbitMQ for a longer period of time, it
    is better to store the MIME message in an external message store. In the
    JSON message you will then not need a "mime" property, but a "key"
    property instead that refers to the key where the message can be found.
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "key": "message-store-key-where-data-can-be-found"
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    If you use the external message store, you must make sure that you store
    either valid MIME messages in this message store, or valid JSON messages
    according to the specification of the <a href="/documentation/responsive-email">
    responsive email specification</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Even when you have configured MailerQ to use an external message store, you
    may still decide to publish full MIME messages to RabbitMQ, and not use
    the message store. Messages published by MailerQ will however always use
    the message store.
</p>
<h3>Keep messages after delivery</h3>
<p>
    When a message is completely processed – either because it was successfully
    delivered, or the delivery failed – MailerQ publishes it to the results queue,
    where you can pick it up for further processing.
</p>
<p>
    By default, MailerQ throws away the mime data to make room in the JSON object
    and in the message store. If you do not want the message data to be removed, you can tell
    so by adding the "keepmime" option:
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-keepmime: 1</code></pre></div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "keepmime": 1
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h3 id="custom-queues">Custom result queues</h3>
<p>
    After MailerQ has processed an email, it publishes the mail to one or more result
    queues. The default queues to use for this are configured in the global configuration
    file, but you can set other queue names in properties to tell MailerQ to use other
    result queues.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-results-queue: name-of-results-queue
x-mq-failure-queue: name-of-failure-queue
x-mq-success-queue: name-of-success-queue
x-mq-retry-queue: name-of-retry-queue</code></pre>

<h4>JSON property</h4>

    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",

    "queues": {
        "results": "name-of-results-queue",
        "failure": "name-of-failure-queue",

<p>
    All properties of the "queues" object are optional. If you leave an option out, MailerQ
    will not use that queue. Thus, if you for example want to process only the errors for a
    certain e-mail, you can only set the "failure" queue. When the delivery succeeds, MailerQ
    will silently discard the mail, without adding it to any result queue.
</p>
<p>
    When the "queues" property is used, the queues mentioned in the global configuration
    file are completely ignored. This is even so if you have not even specified all possible
    queues in the MIME header or JSON object.
</p>

<p>
    Normally, MailerQ delivers all mail to the actual recipient. However, in some cases it is desired that another
    server actually delivers the emails, whereas MailerQ only forwards them to that other server. For these cases,
    the smarthost settings are available. These settings can be set for all messages in the
    configuration file. If all messages are to be routed via a smarthost, this is the best option.
</p>
<p>
    However, for fine-grained control over smarthosts, these settings can also be added in the JSON
    for each message individually. If a smarthost is also set globally, these JSON settings will 
    override that setting as a more precise
    setting.

<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-smarthost-name: hostname-smarthost
x-mq-smarthost-port: 25
x-mq-smarthost-username: example-user
x-mq-smarthost-password: example-password</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>

<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",
    "mime": "...",
    "smarthost": {
        "name": "hostname-smarthost",
        "port": "25",
        "username": "example-user",
        "password": "example-password"
    }
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    If the smarthost option is added, only the name option is mandatory. Port will default to 25,
    and the absence of a username and password simply indicates MailerQ does not need to authenticate
    to the smarthost.
</p>

<h2 id="Custom">Setting custom message properties</h2>
<p>
    To have better control over your message queue, you can set additional properties
    that are included into RabbitMQ message, but will not be send to recipient.
</p>
<p>
    Those properties don't affect sent email at all, they are just for monitoring and
    debuging purpose.
</p>
<h4>MIME header</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox"><pre><code>x-mq-custom-property-name: some debug data that will be visible only in RabbitMQ message
</code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<h4>JSON property</h4>
<p>
    <div class="codeBox">
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{
    "envelope": "my-sender-address@my-domain.com",
    "recipient": "info@example.org",

    "mime": "..."
}           </code></pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    There are some properties that are reserved for internal use and should not be used as
    custom headers. Complete list is below:
