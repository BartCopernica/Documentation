<h1>Function MQ_ev</h1>

<p>
    Internally, MailerQ works with libev for registering timers
    and watching file descriptors and while some simplified wrapper
    functions are available for the MQ_Context, you might find
    it easier to work directly with libev instead.
</p>

<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c">
/**
 *  Retrieve the underlying libev event loop from
 *  the given context
 *
 *  @param  context the context to retrieve the loop from
 *  @return struct libev
 */
struct ev_loop *MQ_ev(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context);
</code></pre>

<p>
    The loop instance that is returned will already be running
    and since it is likely to be handling many other smtp and
    database connections it is highly discouraged to stop this loop,
    since it will most likely break other open connections. You should
    only use it for adding timers and filedescriptors to it.
