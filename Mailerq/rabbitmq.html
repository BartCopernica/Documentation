<h1>RabbitMQ tips and trics</h1>
<p>
    MailerQ heavenly depends on RabbitMQ for all its queueing. You
    therefore need a running RabbitMQ instance (or better: a cluster
    of instances) before you can start MailerQ. We do not intend to write
    a full installation guide for RabbitMQ here (you better check
    the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">www.rabbitmq.com</a> website
    for that), but we do have some tips, tricks and recommendations.
</p>
<h2>Make sure you use the right MailerQ version</h2>
<p>
    The RabbitMQ version that is installed in the repository of your
    operating system might be outdated. You really need a version that is 
    up-to-date, because MailerQ uses a couple of new features that were 
    only recently added to RabbitMQ. So you better download and install 
    RabbitMQ directly from the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">www.rabbitmq.com</a> website
    instead of using the version that comes with your OS.

<h2>Check your login and password</h2>
<p>
    By default, when you first install RabbitMQ, it creates the first user 
    with login "guest" and password "guest". You can only use this default login 
    if you connect to RabbitMQ locally (from localhost). If you connect from a 
    remote host, the "guest/guest" login does not work. Therefore, if you
    install RabbitMQ and MailerQ on different machines, you either need to add 
    a user with a different name and password, or you should configure RabbitMQ 
    to allow "guest/guest" logins from remote hosts as well.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>loopback_users</code> setting in the RabbitMQ config file
    can be used for that. By including this option in your config file,
    you tell MailerQ that it is ok to login with "guest/guest", even if
    the user comes from a remote location. If you do include this setting,
    please make sure that you also have a firewall running, because you
    do not want everyone from all over the internet to connect to your
    RabbitMQ instance!

<h2>Management plugin</h2>
<p>
    Just like MailerQ, RabbitMQ comes with a very nice web interface. However,
    this web interface is not enabled by default, and must be explicitly 
    configured. We recommend doing this, because it is much easier
    to control RabbitMQ via a web browser, than with command line tools.
    You can find an article on the RabbitMQ website that explains how
    to do this:

</p>
<h2>Don't run out of resources</h2>
<p>
    MailerQ not only uses RabbitMQ to fetch the message that it is going to send, 
    but also (if you have this configured) to publish back the delivery results. 
    If you do not process these delivery results in time, you run the risk that 
    your RabbitMQ server runs out of resources. This can especially run in
    a production environment, where many messages are published and
    consumed.
</p>
<p>
    So, when you run MailerQ in production, do make sure that you have set up
    crontabs or other scripts that periodically or continuously process the 
    messages from the result queue. If you do not do this, your RabbitMQ
    server will run out of resources fast.

    message queues, and to pipe the input to scripts to process these
