<a name="TechnicalQuestions"></a><h2>Technical Questions</h2>

<p>
  Before you download and install MailerQ, make sure you have a working <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com" title="RabbitMQ website">RabbitMQ</a> message broker (version 3.3.1+)
  . There are <a href="/documentation/send-email" title="Send email">three ways to send email</a> with MailerQ.
  However, posting messages directly to the AMQP message queue is the fastest way. Below you will find
  the 'technical' questions that are asked most frequent.
</p>

<h3>Does MailerQ support IPv6?</h3>

<p>
  Yes, MailerQ supports IPv6. However, do note that not all receiving mail servers
  have support for IPv6. It is therefore recommended to use IPv4.
</p>

<h3>Can I see my opens, clicks, etc. in MailerQ?</h3>

<p>
  No, statistics, such as opens, clicks and more are handled outside of MailerQ.
  MailerQ focuses completely on the delivery process of your e-mails. All delivery
  related results are registered by MailerQ and returned to the RabbitMQ results queue.
  Here your own application can read and process these results.
</p>

<h3>What happens when an email cannot be delivered?</h3>

<p>
  There are many reasons why an email cannot be delivered (initially). MailerQ will
  automatically place these e-mails in the retry queue and send them again after
  a set amount of time. Each attempt will also add a new "results" property to the
  JSON so you will know exactly what happened during the delivery of the email.

<a name="LicenseQuestions"></a><h2>License related Questions</h2>

<p>
  After downloading and installing MailerQ, you will need a license to be able to
  use the software. This license holds a special 'key', the end date and the IP addresses
  you have specified as the ones you want to use.
</p>

<h3>Where can I find a MailerQ license?</h3>

<p>
  You can find MailerQ licenses on the
  <a href="/product/license" title="Create license">Create License</a> page. On this you can choose
  to create a Free License (which allows you to use one IP address, send 1000 messages a minute and
  expires after one month) or a Commercial License (unlimited messages, unlimited IP addresses,
  renewed montly or annually and professional support). <u>Make sure you add your VAT number
    when purchasing a commercial license</u>. After reading the terms and conditions press
    the 'create' button, pay for your license if applicable, and you can download your license.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I renew a license?</h3>

  <p>
    On the license page of your <a href="/product/license/all" title="personal profile">personal profile</a>
    you can renew your current license. Renewing a license will create the exact same license,
    with the same IP addresses, but with a different end date. <u>Make sure you use the 'create new license'
    option when you want to add new IP addreses</u>.
    </p>

    <h3>What do I do when I want to add new IP-addresses?</h3>

    <p>
      If you want to add new IP addresses to your license there are currently two ways to do so.
      The first one is to add them to your license when you create a new license. This is the easiest
      way if you have a monthly license. If you have an annual license or need to add new IPs right away
      you can contact <a href="mailto:support@copernica.com" title="contact support">support</a>.
      We will have to manually add a new IP addresses to your license. In the future you will be able to do
      so on your profile page.
    </p>


    <h3>What if I accidentally delete my license?</h3>

    <p>
      In the license page of your <a href="/product/license/all" title="personal profile">personal profile</a>
      you can download any of your current and old licenses.
    </p>


    <h3>Are there any extra costs?</h3>

    <p>
      No. Once you have purchased your license we will not charge you anything extra for the services
      offered within that license.
