<h1>Function mq_smtp_in_close</h1>
<p>
    Function that can be implemented by a plugin, and that is called by 
    MailerQ when an incoming SMTP connection is closed. This is the 
    perfect moment for a plugin to run cleanup code, for example to
    deallocate memory that is assigned to the connection with the
    <a href="/documentation/mq_setsmtpdata">MQ_SetSmtpData()</a> 
    function.
</p>
<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c">
bool mq_smtp_in_close(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context, <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> *connection);
</code></pre>
<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
