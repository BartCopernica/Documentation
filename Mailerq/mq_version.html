<h1>Callback mq_version()</h1>
<p>
    When you write your own MailerQ plugin, you must implement the
    mq_version() function. This function is called by MailerQ to find
    out if your plugin is compatible with the MailerQ binary.
</p>
<p>
    Normally, this function can be very simple and just has to return
    the MQ_API_VERSION value. This is an integer value that increments
    with every new version of MailerQ.
</p>
<p>
    <pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;mailerq.h&gt;

/**
 *  Function called by MailerQ to find out if the plugin is compatible
 *  with the MailerQ executable
 *
 *  @return int     API version number for which the plugin is compiled
 */
MQ_EXPORT int mq_version() {
    return MQ_API_VERSION;
}
   </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    If the returned version number is not valid, MailerQ will report an
    error message and quit. If the function number is valid, MailerQ
    will continue to run, and will call your
    <a href="/documentation/mq_initialize">mq_initialize()</a> function.
</p>
