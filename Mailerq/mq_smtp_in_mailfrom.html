<h1>Function mq_smtp_in_mailfrom</h1>
<p>
    Function that can be added to a plugin that is called every
    time a "MAIL FROM" instruction is received by MailerQ.
</p>
<pre class="language-c"><code class="language-c">
bool mq_smtp_in_mailfrom(<a href="/documentation/mq_context">MQ_Context</a> *context, <a href="/documentation/mq_smtpconnection">MQ_SmtpConnection</a> *connection, const char *mailfrom, size_t size);
</code></pre>
<p>
    If your plugin returns true, MailerQ hands over control to your plugin,
    and you should also hand control back. For more information on how MailerQ 
    plugins can interact with the event
    loop, and how control is passed to and from plugins, see 
    <a href="/documentation/eventloop">the article about the MailerQ event loop</a>.
