<h1>Function MQ_SetSmtpData</h1>
<p>
    Function to associate plugin data with a SMTP connection. This  
    data void-pointer is completely ignored by MailerQ, but 
    can be useful for plugins that want to preserve data between
    calls to the plugin callback functions. 
</p>
<p>
    The data pointer is segmented per plugin, so this function will not not
    overwrite data stored by other plugins.
</p>
<p>
    If the data is allocated by yourself, you will also have to make sure
    that the data gets deallocated, for example by also implementing
    the <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_close">mq_smtp_in_close()</a>
    function, in which you deallocate the data after the connection is closed.
