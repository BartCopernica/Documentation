<h1>Function MQ_SetMime</h1>
<p>
    If you want to change the MIME data that is associated with a 
    <a href="/documentation/mq_message">MQ_Message</a>,
    you can use this function. This function sets the MIME data.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
/**
 *  Update the MIME data
 *
 *  @param  message     the message to set the envelope address in
 *  @param  mime        actual mime string
 *  @param  size        length of the mime string
 */
void <a href="/documentation/mq_setmime">MQ_SetMime</a>(<a href="/documentation/mq_message">MQ_Message</a> *message, const char *mime, size_t size);
</pre>
<p>
    This function has a different behavior if you call it on a message
    <i>that is being received</i> and on a message <i>that is being sent</i>.
    If you call it on a message that is being received, for example
    inside your <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_message">mq_smtp_in_message()</a>
    function, it is simply an alias for setting the "mime" property
    in the JSON. Changing the MIME by calling this function,
    will also change the JSON that is going to be published to RabbitMQ.
</p>
<p>
    For outgoing messages however, changing the MIME data with this
    function will not modify the JSON data. If your plugin calls this function
    before the actual data is sent over the SMTP connection, the newly set data
    is going to be used. However, when the message is published
    back to RabbitMQ (for example to the result queue, or back to the outbox queue
    for a retry) it will still use the original JSON object. If you also want 
    to set "mime" property in the JSON,
    you should use the <a href="/documentation/mq_json">MQ_Json()</a> function
    as well.
</p>
<p>
    This function is often used in plugins that implement the
    <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_out_data">mq_smtp_out_data()</a> function.
