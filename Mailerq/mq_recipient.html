<h1>Function MQ_Recipient</h1>
<p>
    If you want to retrieve the recipient from a <a href="/documentation/mq_message">MQ_Message</a>,
    you can use this function for it. It returns a NULL terminated string,
    or simply NULL if no recipient has been set.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
/**
 *  Retrieve the recipient
 *
 *  @param  message the message to retrieve the recipient from
 *  @return         the recipient
 */
const char *<a href="/documentation/mq_recipient">MQ_Recipient</a>(<a href="/documentation/mq_message">MQ_Message</a> *message);
</pre>
<p>
    This function has a different behavior if you call it on a message
    <i>that is being received</i> and on a message <i>that is being sent</i>.
    If you call it on a message that is being received, for example
    inside your <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_message">mq_smtp_in_message()</a>
    function, it is simply an alias for retrieving the "recipient" property
    from the JSON.
</p>
<p>
    For outgoing messages however, the recipient set in the JSON and the
    recipient that is returned by this function may be different. This
    function returns the recipient that is actually being used in the SMTP
    protocol for the "RCPT TO" instruction, and could be different than the 
    one that was originally loaded from RabbitMQ (for example, when a plugin 
    modified the recipient in the mean time).
