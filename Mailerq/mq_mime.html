<h1>Function MQ_Mime</h1>
<p>
    If you want to retrieve the MIME data from a <a href="/documentation/mq_message">MQ_Message</a>,
    you can use this function. It returns a NULL terminated string,
    or simply NULL if no mime has been set.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
/**
 *  Retrieve the MIME data
 *
 *  @param  message the message to retrieve the mime from
 *  @return         the MIME data
 */
const char *<a href="/documentation/mq_mime">MQ_Mime</a>(<a href="/documentation/mq_mime">MQ_Message</a> *message);
</pre>
<p>
    This function has a different behavior if you call it on a message
    <i>that is being received</i> and on a message <i>that is being sent</i>.
    If you call it on a message that is being received, for example
    inside your <a href="/documentation/mq_smtp_in_message">mq_smtp_in_message()</a>
    function, it is simply an alias for retrieving the "mime" property
    from the JSON.
</p>
<p>
    For outgoing messages however, the "mime" property set in the JSON and the
    data that is returned by this function may be different. In fact,
    very often the original JSON does not even hold any MIME data, and
    it is exactly the task of the plugin to <i>generate the MIME</i> based
    on other properties in the MIME. Exactly for that reason, this function 
    normally returns NULL if you call it from a plugin that intercepts 
    outgoing messages - unless some other
    plugin has already set the data using the <a href="/documentation/mq_setmime">
    MQ_SetMime()</a> function.
