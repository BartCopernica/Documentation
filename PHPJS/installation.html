<h1>How to install PHP-JS</h1>
<p>
    PHP-JS depends on a couple of other libraries and applications. Before you install PHP-JS you must make sure that the following other
    libraries and tools are installed:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>C++ compiler (GCC is prefered)</li>
    <li>PHP development environment</li>
    <li>PHP-CPP</li>
    <li>Google's V8 Javascript Engine</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We are not going to help you set up
    a PHP build environment, or tell you how to install a C++ compiler -- Google is your friend here, and there are
    a billion websites explaining how to achieve this. However, PHP-CPP 
    and V8 are less well documented, so we will describe how to install these, before we start with PHP-JS.
</p>
<p>
    During this tutorial you will use Git and Make, and it is assumed that you have these installed.
</p>

<h2>Installing PHP-CPP</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.php-cpp.com">PHP-CPP</a> is a library (also made
    by Copernica, just like PHP-JS) that allows one to create native PHP 
    extensions using C++. PHP-JS is built on top of this library, because 
    the API of the V8 engine also uses C++.
</p>

<h3>Download PHP-CPP</h3>
<p>
    The first thing you have to do, is <a href="http://www.php-cpp.com/download">download PHP-CPP (stable)</a>
    from the PHP-CPP website. And unarchive to your desired location.
</p>

<h3>Build PHP-CPP</h3>
<p>
    Next, we have to build the project. Open the terminal, and navigate
    to the directory where you have unarchived PHP-CPP to. You will find
    a file called <i>Makefile</i>. To build the project, execute the following command:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  make</code>
</pre>
    After building has finished, install the library using like so:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo make install</code>
</pre>
    PHP-CPP is now successfully installed!
</p>

<h2>Installing Google's V8 javascript Engine</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> is Google's open source JavaScript engine.
    You can follow their <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/build">tutorial</a>
    if you prefer, but we think it is a bit vague, so we provide our own step by
    step walkthrough.
</p>
<p>
    Google uses its own wrapper around Git, called depot_tools. 
    You will need this to download the V8 source.
    Depot_tools also has its own <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools">tutorial</a>, but again we provide our own here.
</p>
<h3>Download & install depot_tools</h3>
<p>
    Using the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to store depot_tools,
    and download the project using the following terminal command:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git</code>
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Add depot_tools to your PATH variable</h3>
<p>
    The easiest way to use depot_tools is to add it to your PATH variable.
    Below is the command for doing this. Do not exit the terminal, or your
    path variable will reset!
</p>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  export PATH=`pwd`/depot_tools:"$PATH"</code>
</pre>
<p>
    To test if depot_tools is correctly configured, type the following command:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  gclient</code>
</pre>
<p>
    If installed correctly, a list of possible commands appears, and a .gclient
    directory is created in your home directory.
</p>
<h3>Download & build V8</h3>
<p>
    Next up is downloading the V8 source code. Navigate to the folder
    where you want to store the V8 source folder. Depot_tools provides
    the following command for downloading V8:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  fetch v8</code>
</pre>
<p>
    To build V8, navigate to the V8 source folder, where you will see a
    file called <i>Makefile</i>. Run the following command to build V8:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  make library=shared native</code>
</pre>
<p>
    This can take some time. The <i>native</i> argument makes sure V8
    is built for your current platform, and the <i>library=shared</i>
    argument tells make to build V8 as a shared library.
</p>

<h3>Install V8</h3>

<p>
    Finally, you will have to install V8 manually, as its <em>Makefile</em> does not support <i>install</i>.
    This happens in two steps, the first being the copying of include files.
    Navigate to the folder where you have the V8 source, and enter v8/include.
</p>
<p>
    There are two possible locations you can copy the include files to, and both are provided below.
    For this tutorial, it does not matter which one you choose. Take the
    one you prefer, but if you do not know what to choose, we recommend the first.
</p>

<strong>Location 1 (recommended)</strong>

<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo cp . -r /usr/local/include</code>
</pre>
<strong>Location 2</strong>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo cp . -r /usr/include</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Next to the include files, you also need to copy the compiled libraries.
    Navigate to v8/out/native/lib.target.
    Again, there are two possibilities:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo cp . -r /usr/lib</code>
</pre>
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo cp . -r /usr/local/lib</code></pre>
<p>
    You now have successfully installed Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.
</p>

<h2>Installing PHP-JS</h2>
<p>
    Installing PHP-JS is very similar to installing PHP-CPP.
    Start by opening the terminal.
    Download the library at the <a href="https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/PHP-JS">GitHub page</a> and unarchive it.
</p>
<p>
    Navigate to the PHP-JS source folder, where you will see a file called <i>Makefile</i>.
    Build the project with this command:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  make</code>
</pre>
    When building is done, install the library:
<pre class="language-bash">
<code>  sudo make install</code>
</pre>
    PHP-JS is now ready to use!
</p>
